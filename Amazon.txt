	<P>
		Amazon is a good example of how a good eCommerce store should look, 
		as its user-friendly website design instantly makes it easy for customers 
		to find what they need.To speed up the shopping experience, visitors can 
		use the on-site search engine to look for their desired items, with the 
		multiple filtering options also helping to show the most relevant products.
		<P>Despite having millions of products in its marketplace, Amazon does 
		a great job of simplifying its interface. For instance, all product 
		category pages are hidden in the sidebar hamburger menu.</P>
		<P>This way, users donâ€™t feel overwhelmed by the abundance of options,
 		making the online selling site easy to navigate. </P>
