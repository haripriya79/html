	<P>
		This Icelandic telecommunications company has a one-of-a-kind microsite
		dedicated to its smart home devices. By using an animated 3D house model, 
		it becomes an interactive product demonstration website for Novaâ€™s products.</P>

	<P>	After selecting a product category from the top navigation bar, the page will
		show you where the item is used in the house. When clicked, the website displays
		a range of innovative home products to choose from in that category. </P>

	<P> Though this microsite is best viewed on desktop screens, the website design trans		
		lates well to mobile devices. The top navigation bar transforms into a handy 
		hamburger menu, and the buttons remain visible. </P>
