	<P>
		If you want to make a minimalistic online store, consider Welly for your
		inspiration.This US-based first aid brand has a modern eCommerce website 
		design, putting its products at the center stage.</P>

	<P> The interface is simple and clean with tons of white space. A well-implemented
		typographic hierarchy improves the website’s readability, making it easy for
		customers to understand what the business is about. </P>

	<P>	Another standout feature is the color palette – the website primarily uses 
		white for the background and green for text, while orange serves as the accent color. </P>

	<P>	This color combination helps direct the users’ eyes to essential elements
		like call-to-action (CTA) buttons. This is an excellent practice to improve 
		your conversion rates.
